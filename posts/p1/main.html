<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >To the best of our knowledge, traveling backwards in time is impossible. But, with
our current physics knowledge, it is a possibility that we could travel to the future.
By Einstein&#8217;s special relativity, it&#8217;s a physical law, albeit a somewhat unintuitive
one, that time passes differently for different observers depending on their
speeds. Furthermore, this time dilation has been validated experimentally. A
clock moving at extreme speed experiences less time compared to one that
is stationary. We can model time dilation with some fairly simple math.

<!--l. 23--><p class="nopar" > We call <span 
class="cmmi-10">T</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">0</span></sub> the time in the moving frame of reference and <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>time time in the
stationary frame of reference. Gamma is commonly referred to as the Lorentz factor.
For a quick example of the above equations, say we are moving at 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>9<span 
class="cmmi-10">c </span>or
ninety percent of the speed of light relative to a stationary observer. Then,
plugging in our 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>9<span 
class="cmmi-10">c </span>we find <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>= 2<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>30<span 
class="cmmi-10">T</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>. In other words, for every second that

passes in the moving frame of reference, 2.3 seconds pass in the outside frame
of reference. Now the question if if could we use this principle to engineer
a device, with our current technology, to allow a person to travel to the
future.

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Imagine we have an eccentric billionaire that wants to travel to the future. Maybe
they are tired of living in 2017 and want to travel to 2027. They want to spend a year
in the time machine while ten years pass on the outside. In other words, we have a
Lorentz factor of 10. A current technology that allows us to reach relativistic
velocities is the particle accelerator. We use magnetic fields to confine particles and
accelerate them to a speeds near the speed of light. Imagine we could accelerate a
person in a pod, our eccentric billionaire, along a circular track to those relativistic
velocities. This &#8217;track&#8217; would be inside a vacuum tunnel to remove any friction.
The pod would be accelerated in a manner similar to a maglev train. For
a Lorentz factor of 10 we must accelerate the the pod to roughly 0.995c.
This will be a part of the downfall of the eccentric billionaire&#8217;s plan. Just
to accelerate the pod for the required 0.995c will require huge amounts of
energy.

<!--l. 31--><p class="nopar" > This formula is the kinetic energy of the pod. Let&#8217;s assume that our billionaire&#8217;s pod
weighs around 3000kg. The billionaire needs some food, water, and also likes to
ride in comfort. The weight is also similar to proposed Hyperloop pods. So,
plugging in our mass and Lorentz factor into the equation, we calculate that
the pod, when accelerated, will have a kinetic energy of 2.42 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7; </span>10<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">21</span></sup> J or
roughly 4 times the world&#8217;s energy consumption per year. This does not
take into account inefficiencies in energy conversion and transfer. There
is another pressing issue that puts a bigger stopper to this concept. Even
if the eccentric billionaire could buy enough energy to power his machine
he wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive it. The centripetal acceleration would kill
him.

experienced by the person in the pod, at full speed, would be approximately
9 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7; </span>10<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">12</span></sup> g. For reasonable centripetal forces, the radius would be several light-years,
which is obviously completely unreasonable given current technology.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >In conclusion, with our current knowledge of physics and engineering it&#8217;s not possible
to build a time machine. Maybe the eccentric trillionaire of the 23rd century will be
able to do so. Realistically, we&#8217;re going to need a spacecraft that can make several
light-year journeys at extreme speeds.
